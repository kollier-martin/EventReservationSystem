This project was created to simulate an event reservation system.

We split the project evenly. In the beginning we agreed to go with Python. After the language was decided upon, Nile wrote out the basis of the code (defined methods names and main menu display). I wrote out the explicit code for menus, class definitions, and set up the sockets. Henry helped with file creations and file reading inside of the classes and their functions. Nile and Henry did the final documentations that was turned in.
